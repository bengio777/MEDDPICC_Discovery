# MEDDPICC Discovery Questions

MEDDPICC is an internal qualification compass — not a script to run through with prospects. The goal is to weave these questions naturally into conversations across multiple calls to gather the intelligence needed to qualify, forecast, and close complex deals.

## MEDDPICC Elements & Key Questions

### M — Metrics (Quantifying Value)

Connect your solution to measurable outcomes so it becomes a must-have, not a nice-to-have.

1. "What key metrics are crucial for your business success and how do you report on them?"
2. "What metrics show you that there is room for improvement in your current process?"
3. "If we were to implement our solution, what specific goals would you be aiming for and how would that success be measured?"

### E — Economic Buyer (Final Decision-Maker)

The person with ultimate financial authority to approve the deal.

4. "Who has the final say in purchasing decisions like this, and will I be able to meet with them as part of this process?"
5. "What does success for this project look like specifically for the economic buyer? What are their personal goals and objectives?"

### D — Decision Criteria (Evaluation Scorecard)

The specific technical, financial, and vendor criteria the organization uses to evaluate solutions.

6. "Can you share the specific technical, financial, and vendor criteria you'll use to evaluate potential solutions?"
7. "Are the decision criteria weighted? What are the top 3 'must-have' features or outcomes for this project?"
8. "Are there any intangible factors, like ease of implementation or vendor support, that might influence your decision?"

#### Competitor Bias Detection

Decision criteria are sometimes shaped by a competitor or a consultant with vendor ties. Uncover the origin:

9. "How did you arrive at these criteria? Did you develop them internally, or did you work with an outside consultant or partner to define them?"
10. "Have any of the team members involved in shaping these requirements worked with other vendors in this space before? What was their experience like?"

> If research from the stakeholder mapping reveals that the person who authored the decision criteria previously worked at a competitor's customer, probe carefully. Their criteria may be written to favor what they already know.

### D — Decision Process (Path to Yes)

Who's involved, what steps are required, and the timeline for reaching a final decision.

11. "Can you outline the specific steps your organization will take, from today to a signed contract, to reach a decision?"
12. "Besides the formal committee, who else needs to be involved or consulted for their input or approval?"
13. "What is the timeline for this decision-making process, and are there any key dates we need to hit?"

### P — Paper Process (Legal & Procurement)

Contractual, legal, and procurement steps required to finalize the deal. Many deals die here.

14. "What is the typical timeline for your contract review and approval process? Who handles the legal review?"
15. "Are there any specific legal, security, or compliance checks (like infosec reviews) we should anticipate and prepare for now?"
16. "What will the contract adjustment process look like if changes are needed on either side?"

### I — Identify Pain (The Why)

The emotional and rational driver that motivates change. Without significant pain, prospects won't move.

17. "What is the biggest challenge you are currently facing with [core business process], and how are these challenges affecting your business metrics?"
18. "How have you tried to resolve this challenge in the past, and what were the results?"
19. "Who else in the organization is impacted by this challenge, and what are the downstream consequences for them?"

### C — Champion (Internal Ally)

Someone inside the prospect's organization who believes in your solution and advocates for it when you're not in the room.

20. "Who will gain the most personally and professionally from our solution being successful here?"
21. "Can you help me arrange a brief meeting with [Economic Buyer] to get their perspective?"

> Question 21 doubles as a Champion test — a true champion will be willing and able to connect you with key decision-makers.

### C — Competition (The Battlefield)

Not just other vendors — includes the status quo, internal solutions, and competing budget priorities.

22. "Besides us, what other solutions or vendors are you considering for this project?"
23. "What do you like or dislike about the other options you're evaluating? How does our solution compare in your view?"

## Cost-of-Inaction Quantification

Prospects often don't know what inaction costs them — or aren't ready to disclose it. The goal is to build the number together collaboratively, not demand a figure.

### Building the Number Together

24. "Do you have an estimate of what this might cost you per incident or per month in terms of human capital and time?"
25. "When an incident does occur, what does the response process look like? How many people are pulled in, and for how long?"
26. "What else might we not be considering that impacts your valuable time and resources?"

> Start specific (per incident, per month), then expand the lens together. The prospect will often reveal costs they hadn't considered once the conversation becomes collaborative.

### Domain-Specific Quantification (Cybersecurity Example)

In cybersecurity, use the Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE) framework to help prospects quantify risk:

- **Single Loss Expectancy (SLE):** The estimated cost of a single incident (breach, outage, compliance failure)
- **Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO):** How often the incident is expected to occur per year
- **Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE):** SLE x ARO = the annualized cost of the risk

Questions to build toward ALE:
27. "How many incidents of this type did you experience in the past 12 months?"
28. "For a typical incident, what's the total cost when you factor in response time, remediation, downtime, and any regulatory exposure?"
29. "When you multiply that out across the year, what does the total picture look like? Is that a number your leadership team is aware of?"

> Adapt the quantification framework to the prospect's domain. ALE works for cybersecurity; other verticals may use cost-per-outage, revenue-at-risk, audit failure penalties, or customer churn rates.

## The TED Follow-Up Framework

When a prospect gives a surface-level answer, use the TED framework to progressively deepen the conversation. TED is not three interchangeable question types — it is a **sequential deepening technique**. Each level opens a new layer. Wait for the answer at each level before deciding where to go next.

### T — Tell Me (Open the Door)

High-level, low-pressure. Invites the prospect to expand on what they just said without feeling interrogated.

- "Tell me a little more about what you mean when you say [their words]."
- "Tell me about how that's been affecting your team day-to-day."
- "Tell me what prompted you to start looking at this now."

### E — Explain to Me (Widen the Lens)

Drill into specifics and expand to other stakeholders. This is where you learn whether the pain is isolated or systemic, and whether different people in the organization see the problem differently.

- "Can you explain what [their answer] means for you and your team specifically — and how that might compare to what your CISO is looking for, or what the board expects?"
- "Explain to me how this impacts the broader organization beyond your immediate team."
- "Can you explain the gap between where you are today and where you need to be?"

### D — Describe to Me (Paint the Picture)

Get to concrete detail. This is where the prospect articulates the current pain in vivid terms and begins to envision the desired future state.

- "Could you describe that in a little more detail? What does that pain point look like today — and what would your ideal scenario be?"
- "Describe what a successful outcome looks like 12 months from now."
- "Can you describe a specific situation where this problem caused a real impact?"

### TED in Action — Example

> **Prospect:** "We just need better visibility."
>
> **T:** "Tell me a little more about what you mean when you say you need better visibility."
>
> **Prospect:** "We don't have a clear picture of what's happening across our environment."
>
> **E:** "Can you explain what better visibility means for you and your team specifically, and how that might compare or contrast to what your CISO is looking for — or what the board is asking about?"
>
> **Prospect:** "Well, the board wants to know we can detect and respond quickly. My team needs to actually see what's happening in real time to do that."
>
> **D:** "Could you describe what that pain point looks like today — and what your ideal imagined scenario might be? I'd like to see how we might be able to align to that."

> **Key principle:** Wait for the answer at each level. The prospect's response determines which level comes next — you don't always go T → E → D in order. Sometimes the Tell answer is so rich that you skip straight to Describe.

### The Universal Unlock

When none of the TED starters feel right, use the universal prompt:

- **"Help me understand X."**

This works in any context and signals genuine curiosity without pressure.

## Mutual Commitment Questions

Discovery calls should end with reciprocal next steps — not one-sided action items. Frame the close as a mutual investment: "If I do X, will you do Y?"

30. "Based on what we discussed today, I'd like to put together [specific deliverable — e.g., a tailored agenda, a technical deep-dive, an ROI analysis]. If I bring that to our next conversation, would you be able to bring [specific ask — e.g., your decision-maker, your technical lead, your evaluation criteria] to that meeting?"
31. "What would make the next conversation most valuable for you? And what would you need from me to make that happen?"
32. "We've covered a lot of ground. Can we agree on a specific date and time for our next step, and who should be in the room from both sides?"

> Mutual commitments serve two purposes: they advance the deal, and they test engagement. A prospect who won't commit to a reciprocal next step is signaling low priority or weak champion support.

## Implementation Notes

- **It's a compass, not a script.** Prospects shouldn't know you're using a framework. Gather answers through natural conversation across multiple calls.
- **Don't force all 8 elements into one call.** Early calls → Pain & Metrics. Later calls → Decision Process, Economic Buyer, Paper Process.
- **Adapt to ICP.** Paper process for a large enterprise is vastly different from mid-market. Metrics vary by industry and role.
- **Champion vs. Economic Buyer:** Champion = internal advocate with influence. Economic Buyer = person who signs the contract. You need both.
- **TED is progressive, not rigid.** Use Tell to open, Explain to widen, Describe to deepen — but follow the prospect's energy. If they go deep early, meet them there.
- **Cost of inaction is collaborative.** Build the number together with the prospect. Don't demand a figure — construct it through specific, answerable questions. The prospect will often reveal costs they hadn't considered.
- **Mutual commitments test engagement.** If a prospect won't agree to a reciprocal next step, that is diagnostic information about the deal's health.
