# MEDDICC Qualification Framework

MEDDICC is a sales qualification methodology where each letter represents a key qualification element. It serves as a litmus test for gauging opportunity strength and a GPS for navigating the sales cycle — helping sellers quickly qualify deals in or out so they focus on the highest-potential opportunities.

## The MEDDICC Elements

| Letter | Element | Definition |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **M** | Metrics | Quantifiable measurements and proof of business benefits |
| **E** | Economic Buyer | The individual required for the final "yes" |
| **D** | Decision Criteria | Solution requirements that will be evaluated for the decision |
| **D** | Decision Process | The process to evaluate, select, and purchase a solution |
| **I** | Identified Pain | The customer pain that is a catalyst for solving the problem |
| **C** | Champion | The person with the power and influence to drive the deal internally |
| **C** | Competition | Competitive strengths, weaknesses, and differentiators |

## How It Works

**For Buyers:** Guides them through requirements, options, and risks of the buying process. Ensures the proposed solution aligns with their decision criteria.

**For Sellers:** Identifies critical gaps in customer knowledge or relationships early in the sales cycle, preventing wasted time on deals that will never close.

## MEDDPICC Variant

Some organizations add a **P** (Paper Process) to validate the actions, requirements, and time needed for:

- Releasing funds
- Approving the statement of work
- Legal review of contracts and final approvals
