# Sales Stage Definitions

These stages represent the standard CRM deal lifecycle from first identification through close. They govern pipeline management, forecasting, and deal progression. This workflow (MEDDPICC Discovery Prep, Call, and Follow-up) primarily spans Prospecting/Research through Qualification/Discovery, with the scored MEDDPICC baseline serving as the stage gate into Needs Analysis/Value Proposition.

## Stages

### 1. Prospecting / Research

**Definition:** Identifying potential customers through research, referrals, inbound interest, or marketing activity. Building initial understanding of the account and stakeholders before first meaningful contact.

**Entry criteria:** A lead or target account has been identified.

**Key activities:**
- Account and stakeholder research (LinkedIn, financial filings, legislative drivers)
- Initial outreach or response to inbound interest
- Identifying the right entry point and stakeholder level

**Exit criteria:** A meeting or discovery call has been scheduled with a qualified stakeholder.

### 2. Qualification / Discovery

**Definition:** Determining if the prospect is a good fit and has a genuine need your product can solve. Running the MEDDPICC qualification process to assess deal viability and identify gaps.

**Entry criteria:** A discovery call or meeting is scheduled or has occurred with a stakeholder at the appropriate level (Director of Security or above for this workflow).

**Key activities:**
- Execute the discovery call using MEDDPICC framework
- Qualify across all MEDDPICC elements: Metrics, Economic Buyer, Decision Criteria, Decision Process, Paper Process, Identified Pain, Champion, Competition
- Score the opportunity against MEDDPICC criteria
- Send post-call follow-up with mutual action plan

**Exit criteria:** MEDDPICC scorecard completed with minimum stage gate ratings met (see MEDDPICC Scoring Criteria). At minimum: Identified Pain = Partial, Champion = Partial, Economic Buyer = Partial. A clear next step is agreed upon by both sides.

**This workflow ends here.** The scored MEDDPICC baseline is the output that determines whether the deal advances.

### 3. Needs Analysis / Value Proposition

**Definition:** Uncovering specific pain points in depth and demonstrating how your solution adds value. Moving from "is there a problem?" to "here's exactly how we solve it for you."

**Entry criteria:** MEDDPICC stage gate minimums met from Qualification/Discovery. Pain is at least Partial. A champion and economic buyer have been identified.

**Key activities:**
- Deeper technical discovery with SE involvement
- Tailored demos addressing specific use cases and pain points
- ROI analysis and business case development
- Stakeholder mapping expansion — meeting additional decision-makers
- Competitive differentiation and positioning

**Exit criteria:** Prospect agrees that the solution addresses their needs. A formal proposal or quote is requested. Decision criteria are understood and your solution maps to them.

### 4. Proposal / Quote

**Definition:** Presenting a formal offer or quote to the prospect. Translating the value demonstrated into a specific commercial proposal.

**Entry criteria:** Prospect has requested or agreed to receive a proposal. Solution scope is defined. Pricing model is understood.

**Key activities:**
- Prepare and deliver formal proposal or statement of work
- Pricing and packaging aligned to prospect's needs and budget
- Address any remaining technical or commercial questions
- Confirm decision criteria alignment

**Exit criteria:** Prospect has reviewed the proposal and is ready to discuss terms. No outstanding questions on scope or approach.

---

### 5. Negotiation & Commitment

**Definition:** Discussing terms, handling objections, and securing commitment to move forward. This is where the Paper Process element of MEDDPICC becomes critical.

**Entry criteria:** Proposal has been reviewed. Prospect is engaged in commercial discussion.

**Key activities:**
- Negotiate terms, pricing, and contract structure
- Handle objections and competitive displacement
- Navigate procurement, legal review, and compliance checks (Paper Process)
- Secure verbal commitment and move toward signature
- Manage internal approvals on both sides

**Exit criteria:** Terms are agreed upon. Contract is in legal/procurement review or ready for signature.

---

### 6. Closed Won / Closed Lost

**Definition:** The final outcome of the deal.

**Closed Won entry criteria:** Contract is signed. Purchase order or payment terms are confirmed.

**Closed Lost criteria:** Prospect has declined to move forward, selected a competitor, decided on status quo, or the deal has gone dark beyond recovery.

**Key activities (Closed Won):**
- Transition to implementation/onboarding team
- Document win factors for future reference
- Update CRM with final deal details

**Key activities (Closed Lost):**
- Document loss reason (competitor, status quo, budget, timing, no decision)
- Identify lessons learned for deal review
- Determine if the account should remain in nurture pipeline
- Update CRM with loss details

## Stage Progression Rules

- **Deals can only advance forward** through stages under normal circumstances. Moving a deal backward is a red flag that should trigger a deal review.
- **Stage gate criteria are enforced.** A deal cannot advance to the next stage without meeting the exit criteria of the current stage.
- **Time-in-stage matters.** Deals that stall in a stage beyond the expected duration should be reviewed for deprioritization or disqualification.
- **MEDDPICC scoring drives stage transitions.** The scorecard is the objective evidence that a deal belongs in a given stage.
