# MEDDPICC Scoring Criteria

## Scoring Principles

1. **Evidence over assumptions.** Each rating requires documented evidence — quotes, meeting notes, artifacts. "I think they have budget" is not Partial. "They told me $500K is allocated in Q3" is Strong.
2. **Progressive depth.** Scoring moves from "I don't know" to "surface-level awareness" to "deep, validated understanding." Each interaction should move at least one element forward.
3. **The Strong vs. Partial test:** Can you quote the prospect, or are you paraphrasing your assumption? If you're paraphrasing, it's Partial at best.

## Rating Definitions

| Rating | What It Means | Evidence Standard |
|---|---|---|
| **Strong** | Validated by the prospect with specifics. You could defend this in a deal review with quotes and facts. | Direct statements, named individuals, quantified figures, documented commitments |
| **Partial** | Surface-level understanding. You have directional information but it hasn't been validated or specified. | General statements from the prospect, inferences from research, unconfirmed signals |
| **Gap** | You know this element exists but have no information yet. It's a known unknown and a target for the next interaction. | Nothing — this is your probe list |
| **Unknown** | You haven't assessed this element yet, or it's not applicable at this stage of the deal. | N/A |

## Element-Specific Criteria

### M — Metrics

| Rating | Criteria | Example Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Strong** | Prospect has articulated specific, quantified business outcomes they expect. Success metrics are defined and agreed upon by both sides. | "We need to reduce mean time to detect from 48 hours to under 4 hours. That's the board metric." |
| **Partial** | Prospect acknowledges the need for measurable improvement but hasn't quantified it. General directional goals without specifics. | "We know we need to improve our response times, but we haven't put a number on it yet." |
| **Gap** | No metrics discussed. You don't know how they measure success or what outcomes they expect. | — |

### E — Economic Buyer

| Rating | Criteria | Example Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Strong** | Economic buyer identified by name and title. You have met them or have a confirmed meeting scheduled. You understand their personal success criteria. | "The CISO, Maria Torres, has final budget authority. We're meeting her next Thursday. Her priority is board-level reporting." |
| **Partial** | You know the role or level of the economic buyer but haven't met them. Or you've met someone you believe is the EB but haven't confirmed their authority. | "The prospect says their VP of Security makes the final call, but I haven't confirmed that or met them." |
| **Gap** | You don't know who has final purchasing authority. | — |

### D — Decision Criteria

| Rating | Criteria | Example Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Strong** | Prospect has shared specific, documented evaluation criteria. You know the weighting and must-haves. You know who authored the criteria and have assessed for competitor bias. | "They have a formal RFP with weighted criteria. Top 3: real-time detection, API integration, and FedRAMP authorization. Criteria were developed internally by their security architect." |
| **Partial** | Prospect has mentioned general requirements but they aren't formalized or weighted. Or criteria exist but you don't know who authored them. | "They want something cloud-native that integrates with their SIEM. Not sure if that's formal or just this person's preference." |
| **Gap** | You don't know what criteria they'll use to evaluate solutions. | — |

### D — Decision Process

| Rating | Criteria | Example Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Strong** | You can map the full process from today to signed contract — every step, every stakeholder involved, and the timeline. Key dates are identified. | "Technical eval in March, then a business case presentation to the steering committee in April. Legal review takes 3 weeks. They want to sign by end of Q2." |
| **Partial** | You know some of the steps but not all. Timeline is vague. You don't know all the stakeholders involved. | "They said there's a committee that reviews these decisions, but I don't know who's on it or when they meet." |
| **Gap** | You don't know how they make purchasing decisions of this type. | — |

### P — Paper Process

| Rating | Criteria | Example Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Strong** | You know the specific legal, procurement, and compliance steps required. Timeline for each step is understood. Key contacts in legal/procurement are identified. | "Procurement requires three bids. Legal review takes 2-3 weeks with their outside counsel. InfoSec review is handled by Jake in their GRC team. Standard contract terms are non-negotiable on liability cap." |
| **Partial** | You know there is a procurement and legal process but don't have specifics on timeline, contacts, or requirements. | "They mentioned it has to go through procurement, but I don't know the timeline or who handles it." |
| **Gap** | You haven't discussed the contractual, legal, or procurement process. | — |

### I — Identified Pain

| Rating | Criteria | Example Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Strong** | Prospect has articulated specific pain in their own words. The pain is tied to business impact. They've described consequences of inaction. Cost of inaction has been discussed or collaboratively quantified. | "We had two incidents last quarter that each took 200+ hours to investigate. The board is asking why we can't detect faster. If we don't fix this, the CISO told me her job is on the line." |
| **Partial** | Prospect acknowledges a problem exists but hasn't articulated the business impact or urgency. Pain is described generically. | "Yeah, we know our detection capabilities need work. It's on our roadmap." |
| **Gap** | You don't know what's driving them to look at solutions. The "why change" is unanswered. | — |

### C — Champion

| Rating | Criteria | Example Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Strong** | Identified a specific person who has power, influence, and credibility inside the organization. They are actively advocating for your solution. They have passed the Champion test — willing and able to connect you with the economic buyer and other stakeholders. | "Sarah, the Director of Security Operations, set up meetings with the CISO and the VP of IT for us. She's building the internal business case using our ROI framework." |
| **Partial** | You have a contact who is supportive but hasn't demonstrated influence or taken action on your behalf. Or you believe someone is a champion but haven't tested it. | "The person I'm talking to seems enthusiastic but hasn't introduced me to anyone else yet." |
| **Gap** | You don't have anyone inside the organization actively advocating for your solution. | — |

### C — Competition

| Rating | Criteria | Example Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Strong** | You know who else is being evaluated (vendors, internal solutions, status quo). You understand the prospect's perception of each competitor's strengths and weaknesses. You've identified team members with prior competitor exposure and understand their bias. | "They're also evaluating CrowdStrike and have an internal SIEM build they're considering. Their security architect used CrowdStrike at his last company and is pushing for it. The Director thinks it's too expensive." |
| **Partial** | You know competitors are being evaluated but don't have specifics on who or the prospect's perception. Or you know the competitors but not the internal dynamics. | "They mentioned they're looking at other vendors but didn't name them." |
| **Gap** | You don't know if they're evaluating other solutions or what the competitive landscape looks like. | — |

## Scoring Discipline

- **Score honestly.** Optimistic scoring is the most common failure mode in sales qualification. A "Gap" rating is valuable — it tells you exactly where to focus next.
- **Require evidence for Strong.** If you can't point to a specific quote, fact, or artifact, it's not Strong.
- **Update after every interaction.** The scorecard is a living document. Each call, email, or meeting should move at least one element forward.
- **Not everything surfaces in one call.** A first discovery call may only fill 2-3 elements with confidence. That's expected. The scorecard tracks progress across the full deal cycle.
- **Gaps are targets, not failures.** Every Gap becomes a specific question or objective for the next interaction.

## Stage Gate Minimums

Before advancing a deal from Qualification/Discovery to Needs Analysis/Value Proposition, the following minimums should be met:

| Element | Minimum Rating | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Identified Pain | Partial | Without articulated pain, there is no reason to advance. |
| Champion | Partial | Without someone supporting you internally, you're pushing uphill. |
| Economic Buyer | Partial | You need to at least know who the EB is, even if you haven't met them yet. |
| Decision Criteria | Gap (acceptable) | Criteria may not be formalized until later. Monitor but don't gate on this. |
| Competition | Gap (acceptable) | Competitive landscape often emerges over time. |

> If Identified Pain is rated Gap after a first discovery call, seriously consider whether this deal belongs in the pipeline. No pain = no urgency = no deal.
